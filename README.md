# Grades Calculator

## Description

### What will the application do?

The application will help users calculate their course averages, overall averages, as well as provide a range of possible marks they can receive.

### Who will use it?

Students who want to know how they are doing in a course / term **numerically**.

### Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is interesting to me, because I often find myself using an excel sheet to calculate my averages. I would
have to **manually** input the grades, weighting, and the math formulas for the calculation.
